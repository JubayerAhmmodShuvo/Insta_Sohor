            <h2 class="my-3">Qusetion 1 : How does Javascript work?  </h2>
            <p  class="mb-3" ><strong>Answer : </strong>Computer is an interesting machine but it has its own language, it doesnot understand our language rather we write code in text editor and magically computer do something and turns it into 0 and 1. Understanding how javascript works makes reading and writing code easier and less frustrating and allows one to focus on the logic of one's application instead of fighting with the grammar of the language. All we know that javascript is  single threaded and interpreted language, If I give a JS file to CPU and ask to execute it in browser it won't understand the language rather with the help of javascript engine it translate the language and tells the computer what to do. There are 8 engine in javascript but the fast one is <strong>V8</strong> engine which is written in C++. When we give a javascript file, first it does lexical analysis which break a code into token to identify their meaning and these token will get get formed in tree called AST(Abstract Syntax Tree). Once tree is formed it goes to interpreter which translate and read the files line by line. Then compiler works ahead of time to create a translation of what code we have written and it compiles down to language that can be underwstood by our machine. Google came with V8 engine which combining both interpreter and compailer known <strong>JIT</strong> compiler to make the engine faster. </p>
            <h2 class="my-3">Qusetion 2 : What does Javascript event loop do?  </h2>
            <p  class="mb-3"><strong>Answer : </strong>JavaScript is single-threaded: only one task can run at a time. Usually that’s not a big deal, but now imagine you want to run a task which will take 30sec, and During that task we are waiting for 30 sec before anything else can happen (JavaScript runs on the browser’s main thread by default, so the entire UI is stuck), no one wants a slow, unresponsive website. Luckily, the browser gives us some features that the JavaScript engine itself doesn’t provide: a Web API. This includes the DOM API, setTimeout, HTTP requests, so on and this can help us create some async, non-blocking behavior. The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming, JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. When we invoke a function it's in stack that means first in last out. When a function return a value ,then resopnd function returns a setTimeOut function which is provided us by the web API, it lets us delay the task without blocking the main thread. When waiting for the callback function in the stack the SetTimeOut() is being executed and the Web API is making the mentioned wait.  In the Web API, a timer runs for as long as the second argument we passed to it, 1000ms. </p>
            <h2 class="my-3">Qusetion 3 : Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?  </h2>
            <p class="mb-3"><strong>Answer : </strong>LocalStorage and sessionStorage are part of the web storage API that we have
                access to on our window object. They both allow us to store some data in the browserof the user using
                our web application. <strong>Sessionstorage</strong> actually refers to the time spent without closing the particular tab
                or window. Say for example you open face on browser on your laptop, as soon as you start browsing one
                session starts. The duration of the session is for as long as we have that tab of facebook open in our
                browsers So we can save information into the browser of the user just for the duration of that
                particulat session by using sessionStorage.The elder sibling for sessionStorage is <strong>localStorage</strong>. I
                personally use more than sessionStorage and it's really a powerful mechanism to use. The data inside
                localStorage of the browser will only get removed if the browser is re-installed,the user manually
                removes the localStorage for the browser and your origin or if you yourselfclear the localStorage ofr
                your origin on the user's browser. The memory capacity for localStorage is 10MB as compared to 5MB for
                sessionStorage. </p>
